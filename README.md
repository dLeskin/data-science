1. launch pychram to show color analysis
2. Data science certificate and computer vision courses
3. check skype and RDP




To tell:
Name Velli-Pekka?

Right now I-m optical engineer at lighting technologies. This is one of the top lighting mass production company in our region and we have also plants India, Spain and Ukrane.
I enered here 7 years ago and gained huge expreince both in calculating and manufacturing optics and lighting fixtures.
Now I have over 30 completed projects and two assistants to coordinate. All LED-based projects optics on web-site desinged by me. So if you are interested I can describe any of them in details.

Initially we were bying from LEDIL and chinese for custom optics. I belive you are familiar with LEDIL guys, they made really good business. I-ve visited their place in Salo. Unfortunately most of production moved to china too. So it was about 1 million $ per spent on purchasing optics. I believe that my biggest achivement is that I moved company from buying to manufacturing optics at our plant.

Let me briefly describe the desing process and tools I use:
1) For secondary optics for first order calculation with point source assumption I use mathcad and visual basic. I create mapping in spherical or UV coordinate system. Check conservation of etendue to get the idea about the size. Then upload it to solidworks to check and modify the geometry. I made a routine in VBA that uses Solidworks API to automate this process. Next by bridge I send the geometry to Lighttools or Tracepro to simulate and analysis. After that I rebuild the geometry in optical software to parametrize and optimize. I check all photometric , colorimetric, mechanical tolerance and visual paramters. Analysize manufactoring restrictions, choose the supplier. Usually we make

 Developed image analysis tool (by OpenCV) and methodology for light-beam photos
comparison. LPS LED Symposium LINK;
 Implemented photometry file storage system and file converter to website database;
 Provided luminaire`s LDT analysis tool on web-site (Russian version);
 Complex 3D modeling and rendering of optical systems.
 Deep knowledge in Physics of light, color spaces, spectral characteristics.
